## ðŸŒŒ About Me
Hey there, I'm Peter!

I'm a college freshman at Texas A&M who's currently studying software engineering and data science. My repositories will mainly be comprised of personal projects and class assignments. Eventually I should have a hefty collection of projects showing my progress and growth over the years; well, at least that's what my hope is.
