## üåå About Me
Hey there, I'm Rift!

I'm a college freshman who's messing around with programming. My repositories will mainly be comprised of personal projects and class assignments. Eventually I should have a hefty collection of projects showing my progress and growth over the years; well, at least that's what my hope is.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
I have absolutely no clue what I'm doing.
